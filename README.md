As a seasoned developer, my expertise lies in .NET/C#/ASP.Net MVC. I have hands-on experience with Angular, Node.js, SQL Server, Oracle, jQuery, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Docker. Proficient in Linux, React.js, Vue.js, object-oriented programming, and clean architecture patterns, I am currently delving into SOA design patterns. 

I specialize in clean architecture for the C# language, with knowledge of DDD and TDD with a focus on clean architecture and complex system design decisions and RESTful APIs.

I hold specialization in Software Testing from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. My knowledge extends to Java, C, C++, PHP, web and desktop application development, low-level systems, performance optimization, computer graphics, and the Laravel framework.

ðŸŒ± Currently expanding my skills in C#, Vue.js, React.js, C, C++, COBOL, Assembly, computer architecture, logic circuits, digital circuits, Blazor, and more.
